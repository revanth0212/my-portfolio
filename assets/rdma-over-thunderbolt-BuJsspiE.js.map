Developers are now using **RDMA (Remote Direct Memory Access)** over **Thunderbolt 5** to cluster multiple Macs into a single, high-performance inference engine. This setup allows for \\\"desk-scale supercomputing,\\\" enabling models like Qwen 2.5 Coder or Llama 3.1 405B to run across a distributed pool of Apple Silicon.\\n\\n## The Secret Sauce: RDMA over Thunderbolt 5 ⚡️\\n\\nTraditionally, clustering computers required networking stacks (TCP/IP) that introduced significant latency and CPU overhead. RDMA changes this by allowing one Mac to read or write directly into the memory of another Mac without involving either machine’s CPU or OS kernel.\\n\\n### Performance Specs\\n\\n* **Bandwidth:** Up to **80 Gbps** bidirectional per Thunderbolt 5 link.\\n* **Latency:** Microsecond-scale (reported between **5–14 s**).\\n* **Efficiency:** Bypasses the network stack, drastically reducing the \\\"communication penalty\\\" in distributed training and inference.\\n\\n## Setting Up the `ibv-backend` 🛠️\\n\\nTo utilize these capabilities, developers are moving toward the `ibv-backend` (InfiniBand Verbs) development branch of MLX. This backend allows MLX to communicate over the RDMA fabric natively supported by macOS Tahoe.\\n\\n### Installation Snippet\\n\\nTo experiment with this distributed setup, developers typically need to build the specific development branch of MLX that includes the InfiniBand Verbs support:\\n\\n```bash\\n# Clone the MLX repository\\ngit clone https://github.com/ml-explore/mlx.git\\ncd mlx\\n\\n# Switch to the experimental ibv-backend branch\\ngit checkout ibv-backend\\n\\n# Build and install the framework with distributed support\\npip install -e .\\n\\n```\\n\\nTo launch a distributed job across multiple nodes (e.g., three Mac minis), you would use the `mlx.launch` utility, specifying the network interface corresponding to the Thunderbolt 5 bridge:\\n\\n```bash\\n# Example launch command for a 3-node cluster\\n# node-0 is the coordinator\\nmlx.launch --nprocs 3 --hostfile ./cluster_hosts python distributed_inference.py --model \\\"Qwen/Qwen2.5-Coder-32B\\\"\\n\\n```\\n\\n## Hardware Architecture: The 3-Node Mac Mini Cluster 🖥️\\n\\nConsider a common developer setup: **3x Mac mini (M4 Pro)** with 24GB of Unified Memory each. Using RDMA, these are no longer three isolated computers; they act as a single logical unit.\\n\\n| Resource | Per Node (M4 Pro) | Total Cluster Availability |\\n| --- | --- | --- |\\n| **Unified Memory** | 24 GB | **72 GB** (Pooled) |\\n| **GPU Cores** | 16 Cores | **48 Cores** (Active) |\\n| **Interconnect** | Thunderbolt 5 | **80 Gbps / <14μs latency** |\\n\\n### How It Works: Sharding vs. Pooling\\n\\nIt is important to note that while **memory is pooled**, **compute remains local**.\\n\\n1. **Model Sharding:** The model weights (e.g., a 72B parameter model quantized to 4-bit) are split across the 72GB of total memory.\\n2. **Parallel Compute:** Each Mac mini's GPU calculates the activations for its specific \\\"shard\\\" of the model.\\n3. **RDMA Transfer:** The resulting tensors are passed to the next node via the Thunderbolt 5 link. Because the latency is so low, the GPUs spend very little time idling, resulting in **near-linear scaling**.\\n\\n## Serving Inference Over the Internet 🌐\\n\\nOnce the cluster is running, it can be exposed as a local inference server. By running an OpenAI-compatible API gateway (like `mlx-lm.server`) on a \\\"Head Node,\\\" the cluster can accept requests from the web.\\n\\n* **Internal (RDMA):** Microsecond speeds between Macs.\\n* **External (Web):** Millisecond speeds between the user and the Head Node.\\n\\nThis allows a developer to build a powerful, private coding assistant or LLM backend that rivals professional cloud-based A100/H100 clusters in terms of response time for a fraction of the power and cost.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Summary & Key Takeaways 📝\\n\\n* **The Interconnect is Key:** Thunderbolt 5’s 80 Gbps bandwidth is the \\\"InfiniBand for the rest of us,\\\" making distributed AI viable on the desktop.\\n* **Memory Aggregation:** Clustering allows developers to run models that exceed the RAM of a single machine by pooling Unified Memory across nodes.\\n* **MLX `ibv-backend`:** The shift from TCP/IP to InfiniBand Verbs (RDMA) is what enables the low-latency communication required for high token-per-second output.\\n* **Efficiency:** A multi-node Mac mini cluster provides a massive amount of VRAM and GPU cores with a total power draw significantly lower than traditional server hardware.\\n\""],"names":["rdmaOverThunderbolt"],"mappings":"AAAA,MAAAA,EAAe;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;"}
